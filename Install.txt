The KDAB State Machine Editor Library uses the CMake buildsystem.

Please see the comments at the top of CMakeLists.txt for
the available configuration options you can pass to cmake.

The installation directory defaults to /usr/local on UNIX
c:/Program Files on Windows and /Applications on MacOS.
You can change this location by passing the option
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/install/path to cmake.

To build a debug version pass -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug to cmake.

To build this library you will need:
 - CMake 2.8.12
 - Qt 5.3 or higher

Optional FOSS packages (eg. Graphviz, etc) provide extra functionality.
See the "Optional Dependencies" section below for more details.

Building on Unix with gcc or clang:
% mkdir build
% cd build
% cmake ..
% make
% make install

Building on Windows with Microsoft Visual Studio:
% mkdir build
% cd build
% cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
% nmake
% nmake install

Building on Windows with mingw:
% mkdir build
% cd build
% cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..
% mingw32-make
% mingw32-make install

== Optional Dependencies ==
The KDAB State Machine Editor Library relies on optional (FOSS) dependencies
to provide some of its functionality.  For example, you'll need the Graphviz
visualization software (http://www.graphviz.org) for the state chart automatic
layout feature.

When you run cmake it will inform you about missing dependencies.

Graphviz can be built for you by passing the -DWITH_INTERNAL_GRAPHVIZ=True
option to CMake.  Be advised that Graphviz may have different minimum
requirements for CMake, compiler, etc. than this software.

You can also force CMake to ignore any or all of the optional dependencies
by passing the option -DCMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_<PACKAGE>=True.
For instance:
# tell cmake to ignore Graphiz
  % cmake -DCMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_Graphviz=True
