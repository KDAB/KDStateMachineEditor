 * Buildsystem: add uninstall target
 * Buildsystem: generate and install kdsme-version.h
 * Use official Graphviz from upstream with -DWITH_INTERNAL_GRAPHVIZ=True

 * Fixed build with more recent graphviz versions
 * Buildsystem: new Option BUILD_SHARED_LIBS to select between shared or static libraries
 * Renamed the following CMake options
   * BUILD_DOCS -> KDSME_DOCS
