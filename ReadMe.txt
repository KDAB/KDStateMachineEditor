# KDStateMachineEditor - Library for visualizing and editing state charts

## Introduction

The KDAB State Machine Editor Library is a framework that can be used to
help develop full-featured State Machine Editing graphical user interfaces
and tools.  Output from such applications is in metacode or QML that can
then be used in larger Qt or QtQuick projects.

For a full description of the KDAB State Machine Editor Library, read our
wiki on GitHub, https://github.com/KDAB/KDStateMachineEditor/wiki.

## Screenshots

The main feature of KDStateMachineEditor is visualizing and editing state charts.

Note: A proof-of-concept application called `kdstatemachineditor` executable is part of this repository and will be built automatically.
It can be run from the bin/ directory once the project built.

## Features

* Internal API to create state charts
  * Consisting of states and transitions
  * Also supports history/initial states (in short: everything the SCXML spec provides)
* QML scene which shows the state charts
  * Custom items for drawing transitions using bezier curves
  * Editing: Drag & drop support, move support, etc.
  * Editing: Undo stack implementation, redo/undo actions for all operations
* Abstract interface to layout state charts
  * [GraphViz's cgraph](https://www.graphviz.org/pdf/libguide.pdf) is one of the implemented layouting backends (part of this repository)
* Import/Export capabilities
  * Allows to import/export .scxml files
  * Allows to export .svg files
  * Allows to export .qml files (in [QtQml.StateMachine](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qmlstatemachine.html) syntax)
* Allows to inspect running state machine instances
  * Both supports visualizing `QStateMachine` or `QScxmlStateMachine`
  * Can inspect remote applications (i.e. processes living on another machine)
  * Using [QtRemoteObjects](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtremoteobjects-index.html) for communication
    * Requires the target application to be "instrumented", cf. the [qsmdebugger](examples/qsmdebugger/] example
* Theming support (cf. screenshots above) -- currently available are:
  * DarkTheme
  * SystemTheme

## Building and running

Install the dependencies (here: Ubuntu):

    $ sudo apt-get install cmake qt5-default graphviz-dev \
                           qtbase5-private-dev libqt5qml-graphicaleffects

Build:

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make

Start the test app:

    $ ./bin/kdstatemachineeditor

## Known Issues

The editor part of the library still is somewhat "rough"; not a lot of development time has been spend on streamlining this feature.
KDStateMachineEditor's main user is KDAB's [GammaRay](https://github.com/KDAB/GammaRay), a tool for introspecting Qt application.
GammaRay has the capability to display the state chart of a `QStateMachine` embedded in the application.
It's also possible to inspect the live configuration changes of the state machine.
Zooming into child state (machines) is another feature; all backed by KDStateMachineEditor.
